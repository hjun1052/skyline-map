shot='d-hero',
body=f'''
        <p>This guide takes a city from your save game to a map you can pan, search and plan trips on. It takes about five minutes the first time, and seconds after that.</p>

        <h2>What you need</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cities: Skylines</b> (the original game, not Cities: Skylines II).</li>
          <li><b>The CSLMapView mod</b> by gansaku, from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=845665815" rel="noopener">Steam Workshop</a>. It writes your city to a <code>.cslmap</code> file.</li>
          <li><b>A browser with WebGL</b>, which is any current version of Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mod ships with its own viewer, CSLMapView.exe, which draws a map image from the file. Its author lists it as 64-bit Windows only. <a href="/">Skyline Map</a> reads the same file in a browser, so it also works on a Mac or Linux machine.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: export the city in game</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Subscribe to CSLMapView on the Workshop and enable it in Content Manager.</li>
          <li>Load your city.</li>
          <li>Open the mod's options and press <b>Export</b>. The mod also has an <b>Export and launch the viewer</b> button, which opens CSLMapView.exe afterwards on Windows. You don't need it for this.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The mod can also export every time you save the game, if you turn that on in its settings. Then your newest file is always there when you want it.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: find the file</h2>
        <p>Exports go into a folder called <code>CSLMapView</code> inside the game's install folder. On a default Steam install that is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Windows: <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Cities_Skylines\\CSLMapView</code></li>
          <li>macOS: <code>~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines/CSLMapView</code></li>
          <li>Linux: <code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines/CSLMapView</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The file is named after your city, for example <code>Sarrant-20261107-234707.cslmap</code> when timestamps are on, or <code>.cslmap.gz</code> when compression is on. If your Steam library lives somewhere else, see <a href="/blog/where-cslmapview-saves-files">where CSLMapView saves your files</a> for a quick way to get there.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: open it in Skyline Map</h2>
        <p>Go to <a href="/">skyline.codz.me</a> and drop the file anywhere on the page, or click <b>Choose a .cslmap file</b> and pick it. The start screen also shows the folder for your system with a button to copy the path, and the shortcut that jumps straight to it in the file picker.</p>
        {fig('e-welcome', 'The Skyline Map start screen with its Choose a .cslmap file button', 'The start screen. Drop a .cslmap or .cslmap.gz file.', '(min-width: 50rem) 560px, 100vw')}
        <p class="note">The file is read inside your browser. It isn't uploaded anywhere, so it works the same for a city you'd rather keep to yourself.</p>
        <p>Large cities take a few seconds to build: the map draws roads, lots, buildings, water, forests and terrain from the raw data, then the transit network on top.</p>

        <h2>What you can do with it</h2>
        <h3>Read it like a real map</h3>
        <p>Roads are drawn at their true width, with highways, arterials, local streets and paths each in their own style. Zoned lots are tinted by use, with buildings inside them, and every street name is placed along the whole street rather than repeated on each piece. Station and building labels use the names you gave them in game.</p>
        {fig('d-street', 'Street-level view with buildings, lots, a roundabout with one-way arrows and named landmarks', 'Street level: lots, buildings, landmarks and one-way arrows.')}
        <h3>Tilt it, or switch styles</h3>
        <p>Right-drag to rotate and tilt. Buildings rise in 3D when the camera tilts, and the game's heightmap gives you hillshading, optional 3D terrain and a Terrain style with contour lines. There is also a Night style.</p>
        {fig('d-3d-buildings', 'Tilted 3D view of a city centre with extruded buildings, metro lines and a river', 'A city centre tilted, with 3D buildings.')}
        <h3>Plan trips</h3>
        <p>Directions work for driving, transit, walking and cycling, on your city's own road network and transit lines. How that works is in <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-route-planner">route planning in your city</a>.</p>
        <h3>See the transit network as a diagram</h3>
        <p>The Transit map button draws a metro-style diagram of your lines automatically. More in <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-transit-map">making a transit map of your city</a>.</p>
        <h3>See how far you can get</h3>
        <p>Right-click any spot and the map shades everywhere you can reach in 15 to 60 minutes. See <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-travel-time-map">travel-time maps</a>.</p>
        <h3>Watch it grow</h3>
        <p>Load older exports and drag a slider through your city's history. See <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-time-lapse">making a time-lapse</a>.</p>
        <h3>Measure, search and share</h3>
        <p>The measure tool gives distance, area and an elevation profile. Search finds stations, roads and landmarks. You can also save the current view as a PNG.</p>

        <h2>Common questions</h2>
        <h3>Does it work with Cities: Skylines II?</h3>
        <p>No. CSLMapView is a mod for the first game, and Skyline Map reads its export format.</p>
        <h3>Do I need the mod's Windows viewer?</h3>
        <p>No. Skyline Map only needs the <code>.cslmap</code> file, so the viewer doesn't matter on a Mac or Linux machine.</p>
        <h3>The map looks out of date</h3>
        <p>An export is a snapshot. Export again after you build, or turn on export on save, and open the newest file.</p>

title='Where CSLMapView saves your .cslmap files (Windows, macOS, Linux)',
short='Where CSLMapView saves your files',

lead='CSLMapView writes each export into a folder inside the Cities: Skylines install, which is a few levels deep on every system. Here is where to look and how to get there in a couple of keystrokes.',
shot='e-welcome',
body=f'''
        <h2>The folder</h2>
        <p>The mod saves exports to a folder named <code>CSLMapView</code> in the game's install folder, <code>steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines</code>. With Steam's default library:</p>
        <div class="table-wrap"><table>
          <thead><tr><th>System</th><th>Folder</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Windows</td><td><code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Cities_Skylines\\CSLMapView</code></td></tr>
            <tr><td>macOS</td><td><code>~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines/CSLMapView</code></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Linux</td><td><code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines/CSLMapView</code></td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table></div>
        <p>On macOS, <code>~/Library</code> is hidden in Finder by default, which is why the file can seem to be missing.</p>

        <h2>If your Steam library is somewhere else</h2>
        <p>If you installed the game to another drive or library folder, let Steam find it for you:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In Steam, right-click <b>Cities: Skylines</b> in your library.</li>
          <li>Choose <b>Manage</b>, then <b>Browse local files</b>.</li>
          <li>Open the <code>CSLMapView</code> folder.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The mod can also be pointed at a different output folder in its settings. If you or a friend changed that, the files are wherever it was set to.</p>

        <h2>What the files are called</h2>
        <p>Each export is named after your city. With the mod's timestamp setting on, the date and time are added, so exports never overwrite each other:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Sarrant.cslmap</code>, without timestamps</li>
          <li><code>Sarrant-20261107-234707.cslmap</code>, exported on 7 November 2026 at 23:47:07</li>
          <li><code>Sarrant-20261107-234707.cslmap.gz</code>, the same with compression on</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The compressed <code>.gz</code> files are much smaller. <a href="/">Skyline Map</a> opens both kinds, so there is no need to unzip them. With timestamps, sort the folder by date to find your newest one.</p>
        <p>The same folder holds the mod's Windows viewer, CSLMapView.exe, and its language folders. You can ignore those.</p>

        <h2>Jump to the folder from a file picker</h2>
        <p>You don't have to click through all those folders. Copy the path above, open the file picker (in Skyline Map, click <b>Choose a .cslmap file</b>), then:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>macOS:</b> press <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>, paste with <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>V</kbd> and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.</li>
          <li><b>Windows:</b> press <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to reach the address bar, paste with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>V</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
          <li><b>Linux</b> (GTK file chooser): press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>, paste and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
        </ul>
        {fig('e-welcome', 'The Skyline Map start screen with its Choose a .cslmap file button', 'On the Skyline Map start screen, Need your file? shows the folder for your system, with a copy button.', '(min-width: 50rem) 560px, 100vw')}

        <h2>No file in the folder?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Check the mod is enabled</b> in Content Manager, then export again from the mod's options with a city loaded.</li>
          <li><b>Check the output folder setting</b> in the mod's settings.</li>
          <li><b>Look at the log.</b> The mod writes <code>CSLMapViewMod.log</code> in the <code>Cities_Skylines</code> folder, one level up, which usually says what went wrong.</li>
        </ul>

shot='d-schem',
body=f'''
        <p>Drawing a transit diagram by hand takes hours, and it is out of date the next time you add a line. If you have a CSLMapView export, you can get one in a few seconds and come back for a new one whenever the network changes.</p>
        {fig('d-schem', 'An automatic schematic transit map of rail, metro and ferry lines', 'A diagram generated from one export: rail, metro and ferry lines.')}

        <h2>How to make one</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Export your city with the CSLMapView mod (see <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-city-map">the full walkthrough</a>).</li>
          <li>Open the file at <a href="/">skyline.codz.me</a>.</li>
          <li>Click the <b>Transit map</b> chip at the top, or choose Transit map from the menu.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The diagram opens over the map. Drag to pan and scroll or pinch to zoom.</p>

        <h2>What it keeps from your city</h2>
        <p>The layout is generated, but the content isn't made up. It comes from the network in your export:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Station order</b> on every line, as the vehicles run it.</li>
          <li><b>Line names and colours</b> as you set them in game.</li>
          <li><b>Interchanges</b>, where lines share a station.</li>
          <li><b>Shared track</b>, drawn as parallel lines side by side instead of one line on top of another.</li>
          <li><b>Branches and loops</b>.</li>
          <li><b>Station names</b> you gave in game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then the lines are straightened onto horizontal, vertical and 45° runs with even spacing between stations, the way the London and Seoul maps are drawn.</p>

        <h3>Stations that are one place on the ground</h3>
        <p>In the game, a metro station and the train station above it are separate buildings with separate stops. A good diagram shows them as one interchange. Skyline Map treats stops within 120 m of each other as one place, or within 260 m when their names match, like "Norisa Station" and "Norisa Ferry Pier". It draws them side by side with a walking-transfer link.</p>

        <h2>Using it</h2>
        <h3>Follow a line</h3>
        <p>Tap a line to highlight it and see its stops in order.</p>
        {fig('d-schem-line', 'One metro line highlighted on the schematic map with its stops listed', 'One line highlighted, with its stops.')}
        <h3>Plan from a station</h3>
        <p>Tap a station to see which lines call there, then use <b>From here</b> or <b>To here</b> to plan a journey without leaving the diagram.</p>
        {fig('d-schem-station', 'A station selected on the schematic map, with its lines and journey buttons', 'A station, its lines, and the journey buttons.')}
        <h3>See a route on the diagram</h3>
        <p>A transit route planned in Directions can be shown on the diagram as well, which makes transfers easy to follow.</p>
        {fig('d-schem-route', 'A planned journey highlighted on the schematic map', 'A journey drawn on the diagram.')}
        <h3>Filter by mode</h3>
        <p>Turn modes on and off: train, metro, monorail, tram, ferry, cable car and bus. Buses start switched off, because a city with hundreds of bus lines reads better without them, but you can turn them on. The diagram remembers your choice.</p>

        <h2>Tips for a cleaner diagram</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Name your stations.</b> A station you didn't name shows no label, so a named network reads much better.</li>
          <li><b>Give lines distinct colours.</b> The diagram uses the colours from your game.</li>
          <li><b>Export again after changes.</b> The diagram is rebuilt from each file, so it never goes stale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prefer the real geography? The normal map draws every line in its own colour too, with parallel lines offset so they don't hide each other, and a list of all lines with their stops.</p>

        <h2>Getting directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your export at <a href="/">skyline.codz.me</a>.</li>
          <li>Click <b>Directions</b>, or right-click the map and choose <b>Directions from here</b> or <b>Directions to here</b>.</li>
          <li>Pick a start and an end. You can type a station, road or landmark, or click the map.</li>
          <li>Choose driving, transit, walking or cycling.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You get alternatives where there are any, turn-by-turn steps, and pins you can drag to change the trip.</p>

        <h2>Driving</h2>
        {fig('d-drive', 'Driving directions from the airport to the city centre with three alternatives and their tolls', 'Three driving routes, each with its toll total.')}
        <p>Driving routes use the roads a car may drive on, follow their speed limits and add time at junctions: a little for going straight across, more for a left turn than a right, and most for a U-turn.</p>
        <h3>One-way streets</h3>
        <p>The export doesn't record one-way directions reliably. It marks one-way lanes, but leaves out a flag the game uses to flip a road segment's direction, so the raw data alone gets the direction right only 51–89% of the time, depending on the city. Skyline Map works the directions out from more evidence:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Confirmed:</b> your buses and other vehicles drive that road that way, or junction rules lock it to such a road. These are never driven against. If no route respects them, Directions says there is no legal driving route instead of drawing a wrong one.</li>
          <li><b>Likely:</b> divided roads, where traffic keeps right. These are followed as a rule too. In the rare case where nothing else works, the route is marked with a warning at the spot where it breaks the rule.</li>
          <li><b>Uncertain:</b> only the raw value. A route can use these, but it pays a penalty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Checked against the routes your own transit lines take, the recovered directions come out 97–100% right on the cities we tested.</p>
        <h3>Where a trip starts</h3>
        <p>A trip starts and ends partway along the nearest road a car may use, not at the nearest junction, so the route goes round the block when it needs to. Trips don't begin in the middle of a motorway unless there is no other road nearby.</p>

        <h2>Public transit</h2>
        {fig('d-transit', 'Transit directions with two options, line pills, walking time and fares', 'Transit options with your line names, transfers, walking and fares.')}
        <p>Transit routes use your lines and stations by name. Ride times come from the speed limits of the track or road each line runs on, capped at realistic speeds for each kind of vehicle, with time for accelerating, braking and stopping at each station. Buses also lose time at junctions and in traffic.</p>
        <p>The export has no timetables, so waiting times are estimates and are labelled that way. If you set fares (see <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-tolls-and-fares">tolls and fares</a>), each option shows its price.</p>

        <h2>Walking and cycling</h2>
        {fig('d-walk', 'Walking directions along an embankment, drawn as a dotted line on the streets', 'Walking follows the real paths and pavements.')}
        <p>Walking routes follow pavements and footpaths, and stay off motorways, platforms and other places pedestrians can't go. They join the path network at the nearest point on a path, so the line doesn't cut straight across a block. If a place can only be reached by motorway, the route says so rather than drawing a path that doesn't exist.</p>
        <p>Cycling prefers bike lanes and ordinary roads, and pushes the bike along footpaths when it has to. Turn on the Cycling overlay to see the bike network.</p>

        <h2>What the export doesn't include</h2>
        <p>Some things the game knows aren't in a CSLMapView export, so no route can account for them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Traffic lights and turn bans, including Traffic Manager: President Edition (TM:PE) rules.</li>
          <li>Live traffic.</li>
          <li>Timetables, which is why transit waits are estimates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a closer look at what is and isn't in the file, see <a href="/blog/whats-in-a-cslmapview-export">what a CSLMapView export contains</a>.</p>

        <h2>Everywhere at once</h2>
        <p>Directions plan one trip. To see every place reachable from a spot within a time limit, use a <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-travel-time-map">travel-time map</a>, which uses the same engine.</p>

        <p>Planners call these isochrone maps. They are one of the quickest ways to see whether a neighbourhood is well connected, and in Cities: Skylines they show which areas your metro actually serves and which ones only look close on the map.</p>
        {fig('d-reach-drive', 'Everywhere reachable by car within 30 minutes from a downtown station, covering most of the region', 'Thirty minutes by car from downtown: 42.8 km² of the region.')}

        <h2>Make one</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your export at <a href="/">skyline.codz.me</a> (see <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-city-map">the walkthrough</a> if you haven't yet).</li>
          <li>Right-click the spot you care about and choose <b>How far can I get from here?</b> On a phone, use the menu: it starts from the middle of the screen.</li>
          <li>Pick <b>Driving</b>, <b>Transit</b>, <b>Walking</b> or <b>Cycling</b>, and a limit of 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The map shades everything you can reach in four bands, darkest for the nearest quarter of the time, and the panel shows the reachable land area. Click anywhere else, or drag the pin, to try another start.</p>

        <h2>How the times are worked out</h2>
        <p>The times come from the same engine as <a href="/blog/cities-skylines-route-planner">Directions</a>, so the two always agree:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Driving</b> follows the roads cars may use, obeys one-way streets and adds time at junctions and turns. A place only counts as reached by car near an ordinary road, because you can't stop on a motorway or a ramp.</li>
          <li><b>Transit</b> walks to a stop, waits the estimated average time for that mode, rides at speeds taken from the track or road, and can change lines. Waits are estimates, since the export has no timetables.</li>
          <li><b>Walking</b> and <b>cycling</b> use pavements, paths and bike lanes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From the network, the last stretch to a place is on foot, up to 300 m. Water is never shaded.</p>

        <h2>What it's good for</h2>
        <h3>Finding transit gaps</h3>
        <p>Start at a busy station and pick Transit. Shading that follows the lines in thin ribbons means people only benefit right next to the stops. A district that stays unshaded at 30 minutes, while it is close by car, is a good candidate for your next line or a feeder bus.</p>
        {fig('d-reach', 'Everywhere reachable by transit within 45 minutes, shaded in bands that follow the rail lines', 'Forty-five minutes by transit from the same area: reach follows the rail lines.')}
        <h3>Comparing modes</h3>
        <p>Switch between Driving and Transit from the same start. When the transit area is a small fraction of the car area, your citizens have a good reason to drive.</p>
        <h3>Checking a new connection</h3>
        <p>Build a new line or bridge in game, export again and compare the same start before and after. The reachable area is a simple number to track.</p>

        <h2>Keep your exports</h2>
        <p>A time-lapse needs several exports of the same city. By default each CSLMapView export can overwrite the last one, so first make sure they are kept:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Turn on <b>timestamps in file names</b> in the mod's settings. Each export then gets its own file, like <code>Sarrant-20261107-234707.cslmap</code>.</li>
          <li>Optionally turn on <b>export on save</b>, so a new file appears every time you save the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They all land in the same folder (<a href="/blog/where-cslmapview-saves-files">here's where</a>). The more saves you have, and the more spread out they are, the smoother the time-lapse.</p>

        <h2>Make the time-lapse</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your <b>newest</b> export at <a href="/">skyline.codz.me</a>.</li>
          <li>Open the menu and choose <b>City time-lapse</b>, then <b>Choose older exports</b>.</li>
          <li>In the file picker, select your older exports. Selecting the whole folder is fine: files from other cities, and exports newer than the open one, are skipped.</li>
          <li>Drag the slider, or press <b>Play</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        {fig('e-lapse', 'The time-lapse panel: an export date, a slider with Play, and the building count and road length at that date', 'Each step shows the export date, the number of buildings and the road length.', '(min-width: 50rem) 420px, 100vw')}
        <p>Reading is quick, because only the identities of roads, buildings and lines are read from the older files, not their shapes. Twenty-eight exports of a large city take a few seconds.</p>
        <p>To select many files at once: on a Mac, click the first file and Shift-click the last, or press <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>A</kbd>. On Windows, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> instead of <kbd>⌘</kbd>.</p>

        <h2>How it works, and its limits</h2>
        <p>The map you see is always your newest export. Each road, building and transit line in it is matched against the older files, and appears from the first export that already had it.</p>
        <p>Cities: Skylines reuses ids after something is demolished, so an id alone could credit a brand-new road to an old one that used the same slot. Skyline Map therefore matches a road by its id and the two junctions it connects, a building by its id and its asset, and a line by its id and type.</p>
        <p>Because only the newest export is drawn, anything you demolished along the way doesn't appear in earlier frames. If you rebuilt a whole district, the time-lapse shows the new version appearing, not the old one disappearing.</p>

        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Record it.</b> Zoom to a part of town that changed a lot, press Play and screen-record it. Short clips like that are popular on city-builder forums.</li>
          <li><b>Track your growth.</b> The building count and road length per export are a quick record of how fast the city grew.</li>
          <li><b>Combine with transit.</b> Leave the transit layer on and watch your network spread across the map.</li>

          <li>Road islands: stretches of road with no road link to the rest of the city.</li>

        <h2>Measured, not guessed</h2>
        <p>Every number comes from your export: lengths from the road and track geometry, heights from the nodes and terrain, counts from the network. The export has no traffic, passenger numbers or building heights, so there are no records about those.</p>
        <p>A record only appears when your city has a clear one. A small town gets fewer records than a big city, and a city with no railway has no railway records.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>A tap on an ordinary road closes the stretch between the junctions at either end. A bridge or tunnel closes as a whole, with the other carriageway of a divided road. For a named road you can also close all of it at once.</p>

        <h2>What you see</h2>
        <h3>The verdict</h3>
        <p>One line sums it up: <b>No way around</b>, <b>Long detour</b>, <b>Noticeable detour</b>, <b>Barely matters</b> or <b>No trips affected</b>. It comes straight from the trip times below it, and it says when only one way of travelling is stuck, for example a bridge cars can drive round but people on foot can't.</p>
        <h3>Trips across it</h3>
        <p>Each direction a car may legally drive the closed stretch gets a row, plus a row on foot, with bars for the time before and after. Tap a row to see the old route and the detour on the map.</p>

        <h3>Lines and stations</h3>
        <p>Transit lines that run over the closure are cut there. The parts on either side keep running, and the trips between the stations either side of the cut are timed again. Close a station and its lines run through without stopping; the panel shows the nearest station that is still open and how far it is to walk.</p>
        <h3>What can you reach in 30 minutes?</h3>
        <p>A pin starts on one side of the closure (or at the station). Choose driving, transit, walking or cycling and the map shades everywhere within 30 minutes: before, after, or the change, from no change to more than 15 minutes slower, or lost altogether.

          <li><b>No diversions:</b> lines over the closure are cut, not rerouted, because there's no way to know how you'd reroute them.</li>
          <li><b>No traffic:</b> the export has no traffic, passenger or cost figures, so nothing here estimates them. It shows how the network connects, not how busy it would get.</li>

          <li><b>Find your weak links.</b> Close each bridge to an island or across a river. A "No way around" is a place that needs a second crossing.</li>
          <li><b>Check a new line.</b> Close an old station and see whether the new line gives people somewhere close to go instead.</li>

        <h2>Where your prices are kept</h2>
        <p>Prices are saved in your browser for each city, not in the map file. When you open a newer export of the same city, they are matched back to the same booths and lines by id, name and position, so they carry over. Prices that no longer match anything are kept, not thrown away.</p>
        <p>You can export your prices as a JSON file and import them on another computer or browser.</p>

lead='A .cslmap file is a snapshot of your city written out by the CSLMapView mod. Knowing what is in it explains what a map made from it can show, and where it has to estimate.',
shot='d-building-asset',
body=f'''
        <p>A <code>.cslmap</code> file is XML, and <code>.cslmap.gz</code> is the same file compressed. Cities are big, so files of 10–20 MB uncompressed are normal for a developed map.</p>

        <h2>What's in it</h2>
        <h3>The road and path network</h3>
        <p>Every network segment is there: roads, highways, paths, rail and metro track, bridges and tunnels. Each one has its shape, its width, its network type, and the type's lanes with their direction, vehicle type and speed limit. Road names are included, plus any custom name you gave.</p>
        <p>Nodes (the points segments meet at) have positions and heights. They also carry an "on ground" flag, which tells a real bridge or tunnel apart from a road that only looks raised because the terrain under it is coarse.</p>
        <h3>Buildings</h3>
        <p>Every building has its position, footprint, type, and the name you gave it in game, if any. Larger assets made of several buildings, like a station with separate halls and platforms, a stadium's stands or a mall's wings, are linked together in a chain. Skyline Map follows that chain, so clicking any part selects the whole asset.</p>
        {fig('d-building-asset', 'A station made of 25 buildings, all highlighted as one asset', 'One station made of 25 buildings, selected as one asset.')}
        <h3>Transit</h3>
        <p>Each transit line has its name, type, colour and stops in order. Stations take the names you gave them.</p>
        <h3>Terrain, water and forests</h3>
        <p>The heightmap, the water surface and sea level, and a forest density grid. Hillshading, contours, 3D terrain, shorelines and woods all come from these.</p>
        <h3>Districts and parks</h3>
        <p>District and park names, each with one label point.</p>

        <h2>What isn't in it</h2>
        <div class="table-wrap"><table>
          <thead><tr><th>Missing</th><th>What Skyline Map does about it</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>District shapes</td><td>Estimates each district's area from its label point and the transit stops that record their district. A selected district is drawn as a soft region that fades toward its neighbours, and its area is labelled as an estimate.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Building heights</td><td>Estimated from each building's zone and level for the 3D view.</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table></div>

        <h2>Why the names you give matter</h2>
        <p>The export includes the names you typed in game for stations and buildings. Those are what appear on the map, in search, on the transit diagram and in transit directions. A station you never named appears as an icon without a label, so naming the important ones makes every view clearer.</p>

        <h2>Export settings worth knowing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Compression</b> writes <code>.cslmap.gz</code>, which is much smaller and opens the same way.</li>
          <li><b>Timestamps in file names</b> keep every export instead of overwriting the last one.</li>
          <li><b>Export on save</b> writes a new file each time you save the game.</li>
          <li><b>Output folder</b> moves exports somewhere other than the default. See <a href="/blog/where-cslmapview-saves-files">where the files go</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is my city uploaded when I open it?</h2>
        <p>No. Skyline Map reads the file in your browser and builds the map on your computer. Nothing is sent to a server.</p>
